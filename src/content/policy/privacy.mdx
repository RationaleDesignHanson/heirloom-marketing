# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: {meta.lastUpdated}_

Heirloom Recipe Box (“Heirloom,” “we,” “us”) helps you save, organize, and share recipes. We designed Heirloom to be private by default and to use your information only to provide and improve the app—not to sell your data or to track you across other companies’ apps and websites.

## 1) Information We Collect

### A) Account Information
- **Email address** (to create and secure your account)
- **User ID** (used to associate your data with your account)

### B) Content You Provide
- **Recipes and recipe metadata** you create, import, save, or edit (titles, ingredients, steps, notes, tags, etc.)
- **Photos and images** you upload or capture (e.g., recipe photos, cookbook/page photos)
- **Audio/video content** you submit for processing (e.g., voice dictation, video imports)

### C) Usage Data
- **Product interactions** such as recipe saves, collections created, and features used (used to improve Heirloom)

### D) Diagnostics
- **Crash logs and diagnostics** (device information and crash details) to help us fix reliability issues

## 2) How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect to:
- Provide core app functionality (saving, organizing, searching, and sharing recipes)
- Sync your content across devices (when enabled)
- Improve product quality and performance (analytics and crash reporting)
- Communicate service-related messages (e.g., account/security notices, support replies)

We do **not** sell your personal information. We do **not** use your information for interest-based advertising.

## 3) Sharing & Visibility Controls
Heirloom is private by default:
- Your personal recipe box and collections are private unless you choose to share.
- You can share recipes directly with friends/family (peer-to-peer).
- You can optionally publish recipes to the public Discover/community feed **only when the recipe is yours** (your original recipe, your adaptation, or content you have permission to publish).

## 4) Third-Party Service Providers (Processors)
We use trusted third-party services to operate the app. These providers process data on our behalf, consistent with this policy.

### Core Infrastructure
- **Firebase Authentication (Google)** — account management
- **Firebase Firestore (Google)** — data storage (recipes, collections, sharing metadata)
- **Firebase Storage (Google)** — image/media storage (recipe photos, scans)

### Analytics & Diagnostics
- **Firebase Crashlytics (Google)** — crash reporting and diagnostics
- **Mixpanel** — product analytics (event analytics; may be conditionally enabled)
- **Google Analytics (App Measurement)** — usage analytics (if enabled)

### AI / Processing
Heirloom may send recipe content you submit (text/images/audio/video) to AI providers to extract or generate recipe data. We use this only to provide the feature you requested (e.g., “import this recipe,” “generate a recipe”), not to advertise to you.

Depending on which features you use, processors may include:
- **Anthropic (Claude API)** — recipe extraction/parsing and AI features
- **OpenAI** — AI processing (legacy fallback where applicable)
- **Replicate** — AI image generation (e.g., Flux)
- **Google Vision API** — OCR for handwritten or photographed recipes
- **WhisperKit** — on-device speech transcription (where applicable)

### Search & Discovery
- **Algolia** — search (fuzzy matching, query indexing)
- **Brave Search API** — web recipe search (where applicable)

### Subscriptions / Purchases
- **Apple StoreKit** — in-app purchases and subscriptions (Apple processes payment information)

## 5) Data Retention
We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service. You can request deletion (see “Your Choices & Rights”).

## 6) Security
We use industry-standard safeguards to protect data, including encryption in transit (HTTPS) and access controls for backend systems.

## 7) Your Choices & Rights
Depending on where you live, you may have rights to:
- Access or export your data
- Correct your data
- Delete your account and associated data
- Opt out of certain analytics where applicable

### How to Delete Your Account
To delete your account:
- In the app: go to **Settings → Account (or Privacy) → Delete Account**, and follow the prompts.  
- If you can’t access the app, email **admin@rationale.work** with the subject: **“Account Deletion Request”** and include the email address on your account.

## 8) Children’s Privacy
Heirloom is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 9) International Users
If you access Heirloom from outside the United States, your data may be processed in the United States or other locations where our service providers operate.

## 10) Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we’ll update the “Last updated” date and may provide additional notice.
